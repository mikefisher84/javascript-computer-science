//SORTING ALGORITHMS
// Arranging data in a collection based on a comparison algorithm
// Two general families of sorting algorithms
// 		Linear sorting
// 		Divide and conquer

// Linear algorithms treat the problem of sorting as a single large operation.
// Divide and conquer partition the data into smaller sets that can be independantly sorted

// Measuring performance
// 	Number of Comparisions
// 		when two values of the input array are compared for relative equality
// 	Number of Swaps
// 		when two values in the input array are swaped
//
// Performance considerations
// 	comparisions and swaps both have a cost
// 	reducing either or both can improve performance
// 	the cost of both operations depends on many factors
